Differential Evolution
***********************

The Differential Evolution plugin is used to fit an SBML modelâ€™s parameters to experimental data. The plugin has numerous properties to allow the user full control over the internal fitting engine, as well as access to generated fitted data after a minimization session. In addition, various statistical properties, such as standardized residuals, Q-Q data, ChiSquare and reduced ChiSquare are made accessible to the user. The resulting parameter values also come with estimated confidence limits.
The current implementation is based on the Differential Evolution C++ implementation by Kenneth Price and Rainer Storn.


Start using rrplugins package by importing the library and creating a Plugin instance. 

     >>> from rrplugins import *
     >>> chiPlugin = Plugin("tel_chisquare") 
     >>> modelPlugin = Plugin("tel_test_model") 
     >>> addNoisePlugin = Plugin("tel_add_noise") 
     >>> de = Plugin("differential_evolution")
